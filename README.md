# NBA-basketball---SQL-and-NoSQL

## HW 1
Choose an application domain and, using a relational DBMS, build a database:
Get interesting data from the Web or other sources and build a relational database using such data. Then formulate a set of **SQL queries** (about 8-10) over the relational schema. Execute such queries over the database and analyze the results.

## HW 2
Starting from the database developed in the first homework, every group has to identify at least 2\*n SQL queries (where n is the number of students in the group) that pose performance problems to the DBMS. The students have to show how the use of indices and/or views and/or integrity constraints and/or query reformulation and/or schema restructuring makes query execution significantly faster on the DBMS.

## HW 3
Use a NoSQL tool to manage and query a dataset (**MongoDB**). Ideally, the groups should use the same dataset as the one used in the first (and/or second) homework.
